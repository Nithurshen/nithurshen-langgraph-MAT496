## Module 0:
I've learned the fundamentals of setting up a LangChain environment and interacting with its core components. The course covered how to instantiate different ChatOpenAI models, like gpt-4o and gpt-3.5-turbo, and how to use the .invoke() method to send prompts. It also introduced the integration of external search tools, specifically using TavilySearchResults. I've put these concepts into practice in my own notebook by experimenting with other models like gpt-4.1-nano and gpt-4o-mini. To align the exercise with my interest in Formula 1, I modified the tool run by changing the TavilySearchResults query to "Who is Max Verstappen?" and increased the max_results parameter to 50 for a more extensive search.
